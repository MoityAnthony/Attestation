    "Html": "Ok, it seems that I can set bookmarks with addTitle() and get the (automatically generated?) name with getAnchor(). In a natively generated word document (saved directly with Word) the &lt;w:hyperlink&gt; nodes contain the attribute &quot;w:anchor&quot; which stores the name of the bookmark node. But I found no way to set this attribute through PHPWord. I tried to create a link with:\r<br />\n<br />\n$section-&gt;addLink(&quot;_Toc252634155&quot;, &quot;Title 3&quot;);\r<br />\n<br />\n.. but this didn't work. PHPWord stores the target somewhere else but not in the file word\\document.xml in the &quot;w:anchor&quot; attribute. Does anyone have an idea? Please help.<br />\n",
