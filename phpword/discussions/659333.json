I have tried to work my way through the installation instructions but I don't really know what I am doing and so after I have done a step I don't know how to check if I've done it properly.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy server is Windows Server 2008 running IIS.  What I have done so far:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nDownloaded php-5.6.28-nts-Win32-VC11-x86 and installed this.  This appears to be working as when I load my test.php page with  phpinfo();  it shows a page with a load of info and PHP Version 5.6.28 at the top.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nI then installed composer on the server - I know this is working as it downloaded stuff for me in later steps of the installation.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nOn the server I then typed composer require zendframework/zendframework and it downloaded a bunch of stuff - I am not sure where it actually put everything but it seemed to have worked.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nOn the server I then typed composer require phpoffice/phpword &quot;v0.13.*&quot; this downloaded and installed pclzip, common and phpword files.  Again, I don't know where those files actually went but it seems to have worked.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThings I am unsure of at this point:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Do I need to do anything with regards XML Parser extension</li>\n<li>What is Zend\\Stdlib component and how do I get it</li>\n<li>\nWhat is Zend\\Validator component and how do I get it<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nMy test script begins with this:\r<br />\n<br />\n&lt;?php\r<br />\nrequire_once 'bootstrap.php';\r<br />\n<br />\n// Creating the new document...\r<br />\n$phpWord = new \\PhpOffice\\PhpWord\\PhpWord();\r<br />\n?&gt;\r<br />\n<br />\nMore questions:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nWhat is bootstrap.php and does my php script know where to look for it?  Does bootstrap.php need to be in the same folder as my test script?<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nI am getting a 500 error when I run my test script - do I need to tell IIS where the phpword library is or should composer have done that for me?<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThanks very much - like I say I am starting from zero knowledge.  I'd be happy to turn an answers into a complete beginner's guide and make it available to all.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks very much\r<br />\n<br />\nEd<br />\n",
