I used PHPExcel for the excel files and it works great.\r<br />\n<br />\nI now need to load a preformatted file just like I did in PHPExcel using the filereaders. Here is my code but it does not load the file.<br />\n<pre><code>//generate word file for gwentries\n$PHPWord = new PHPWord();\n$document = $PHPWord-&gt;loadTemplate(APPPATH.'files/gwsw.doc');\n\n// save file\n$wordWriter = PHPWord_IOFactory::createWriter($PHPWord, 'Word2007');\n$wordWriter-&gt;save('files/test.doc');</code></pre>\n\nAny help would be great. Thanks<br />\n",
