There is no documentation anywhere saying how the word file should be set up. Is it a field or just text? Who knows. The documentation for PHPWord is very disappointing after using PHPExcel which was a great product. <br />\n<br />\nI can load the template and create a new file with it but setValue() does absolutely nothing.<br />\n<br />\nVery frustrating.<br />\n",

Its difficult to tell if its the problem I've solved, or something different. :)<br />\n",
