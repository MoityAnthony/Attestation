I will try to make myself clear.\r<br />\n<br />\nI encounter a problem since this morning.\r<br />\n<br />\nI create two rows an a table, on this two row i have 5 cell. Cell 1 on Row 1 and Cell 1 and Row 2 are merged. \r<br />\nAll is working fine till this but : when there is a new page sometimes rows are on different page so my merged cells are split in two. \r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI try to add this : addRow(250, array(<strong>'cantSplit' =&gt; true</strong>));\r<br />\n<br />\nBut there is now effect because i have two rows.\r<br />\n<br />\nI see that cantSplit is only for rows but i'm looking for the same for merge cell.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you have some ideas to avoid this issue ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
