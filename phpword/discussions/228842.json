In PHPExcel, it's still possible to use the original 'xls' format,\r\n so you can bypass that hurdle, but apparently PHPword can't.</p>\r\n<p>Or does it still support the older 'doc' format. that doesn't rely on ZipArchive?&nbsp; It would open up the tool for loads of people that use hosted solutions (a good sized target group I would imagine).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
