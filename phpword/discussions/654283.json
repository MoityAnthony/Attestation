There are also replacements for $$DATE$$, $$AREA$$, $$OUTLET$$ and others.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, there is also one image embedded in the word files that should be replaced with the one linked in my $logo variable. The pictures are both the same size and same location.<br />\n<br />\nHow would I best go about this and can WordPHP actually do this?<br />\n<br />\nThank you,<br />\nPatrick<br />\n",
