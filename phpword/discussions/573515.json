Done by $doc=$wa-&gt;load(...);<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nI tried to modify the document's meta data with some dynamic contents too. <br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nIt seems that a PhpOffice\\PhpWord\\Template $doc object does not have a getProperties method as there is in a PhpOffice\\PhpWord\\Phpword $wa object; while a $wa object does not have setValue method as in $doc.<br />\n<br />\nThe saving of the modifiled template is via $doc-&gt;save but it does not encapsulate what I did in $wa. <br />\n<br />\nAny hints?<br />\n",
