It recursively steps through the dom tree created by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/\">PHP Simple HTML Dom</a>&nbsp;creating elements in PHPWord as it does so. It handles HTML elements including tables, paragraphs, links, images, lists, it could also handle some basic CSS. In using such a converter it is necessary to make decisions about how you want the HTML to be converted into the Word document - for example in my set up paragraphs are converted to a text run followed by a text break, words within PHPWord list elements don't seem to be separately stylable (important for our use), so I create text runs beginning with a number or bullet as required.</p>",
