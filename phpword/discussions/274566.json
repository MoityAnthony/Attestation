But, because they aren't constant, the number of rows varies each time. Therefore I have to add a Row in the table and write the text in it. Unfortunatly I couldn't manage to add a row in my template.</p>\n<p>I have already tried some things to make this thing working, and I've looked into the documentation but I still don't know where to start with... .</p>\n<p>Am I blind and didn't see the documentation? Do you have any suggestinos?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>so far</p>\n<p>choallin</p>",
