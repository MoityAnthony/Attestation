Once I have this working I will attempt to play with the document more.<br />\n<br />\nHowever I am now getting the following error:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFatal error: Call to a member function loadTemplate() on a non-object in /home/sites/iso-drive.co.uk/public_html/portal/include/global_companies_events.php on line 110<br />\n</blockquote>\nphpinfo file is <a href=\"http://portal.iso-drive.co.uk/phpinfo.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a><br />\n<br />\nIf I remove any of the code I then get fatal error, cannot redeclare etc.<br />\n<br />\nI'd be very grateful for some assistance.<br />\n<br />\nPS.<br />\n<br />\nIf I change code to:<br />\n<pre><code>require_once '/home/sites/iso-drive.co.uk/public_html/portal/plugins/PHPWord/Template.php';\nrequire_once '/home/sites/iso-drive.co.uk/public_html/portal/plugins/PHPWord.php';\n$PHPWord = new PHPWord();\n$template = $PHPWord-&gt;loadTemplate('$name1');\n$template-&gt;save('/Templates/test.docx');\nunset($template);</code></pre>\n\nThen I get the following error:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFatal error: Cannot redeclare class PHPWord_Autoloader<br />\n</blockquote>\n",
