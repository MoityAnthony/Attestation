I have the correct version of PHP and the ZipArchive extension appears to be present, but I'm confused about the &quot;xmllib&quot; extension. How can I check if this is present and is &quot;xmllib&quot; the same as &quot;libxml&quot;? The documentation is pretty vague on all of this.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help greatly appreciated.<br />\n",
