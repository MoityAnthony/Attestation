But this doesn't work.<br />\nAlso I tried using addText().<br />\n<br />\nBut perhaps PHP Word doesn't allow formatting of text elements 'On the Fly'.<br />\n<br />\nCan someone please drop a hint?<br />\n",

The only solution that I can find is you must be able to read the DOCX content, put it into PHPWord objects, and manipulate the objects with PHPWord methods.\r<br />\n<br />\nWe're working on <a href=\"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord/issues/70\" rel=\"nofollow\">DOCX Reader</a>.
