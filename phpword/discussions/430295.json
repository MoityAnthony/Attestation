If I simply end my program there and then, a default file is created in the same directory as the template file\r\n and there is, to my knowledge, no built-in method to close the template file opened with loadTemplate.</p>\r\n<p>I've been trying to create my own close method for the PHPWord_Template object but I'm not familiar with such systems. Could anybody point me in the right direction?</p>\r\n",
