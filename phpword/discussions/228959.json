This would give me the information, f.e. if the complete TextElement would fit into the current page or if i should place it on the next page.</p>\r\n<p>Another problem is the positioning of elements in the document. I cannot position an Image right/left to a text. A workaround would be to use tables, is there any other method for positioning the elements or creating a text circumfluent?</p>",
