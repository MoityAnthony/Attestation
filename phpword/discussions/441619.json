I tried the following:\r<br />\n<br />\n$styleTable = array('borderSize'=&gt;6, 'left'=&gt;3000, 'top'=&gt;3000, 'borderColor'=&gt;'006699', 'cellMargin'=&gt;80);\r<br />\n<br />\nIt didn't change anything.  I'm trying to place text at a specific location on the page, like writing to pdf docs allows you to do.  I was planning on using a 1 cell table if it worked.<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat I'd really like is a TextBox field.  If it's not available and someone could give me some ideas on where to start, I could maybe hack one in if it's not too complex.  The one complexity seems to be in the fact that it needs to be embedded in a drawing area, so you'd need a drawing area object as well.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",
