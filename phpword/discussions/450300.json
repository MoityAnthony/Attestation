Can somebody give me the 'basic' explanations?... \r<br />\n<br />\nWhat have I to do with the 'zip'-file? Where and how (Fillezilla?) have I to place this files on my website (on the directory 'www'? on the directory 'libraries', of on an other directory?).\r<br />\n<br />\nCan you also give me the first lines of a workable script? What are the first sentences of that script? ('include &quot;PHPWORD&quot;'? or must that be 'include \\libraries\\PHPWORD\\phpword.php', or something like that?...\r<br />\n<br />\nYou see, I miss the essentiels to make working PHPWORD...\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks in advance for your reply, World!...<br />\n",
