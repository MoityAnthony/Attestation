I believe it is possible to use PEAR to download the missing packages - I tried it when I was using PHP 5.1, but it was painful and I seem to remember other problems were created in the process\r\n - personally I wouldn't think it would be worth the effort. Neither PHP 5.1 nor PHP 5.2 are supported by the PHP project any more.</p>\r\n",
