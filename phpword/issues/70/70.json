    "Description": "It seems like whenever I attach an PHPWord generated document to an email, and try to read this doc on an Android device, it will not work. I use an Samsung S3, and always get \"Polaris Viewer 4.1 has stopped\".\r\nOther Android devices get the same error.\r\n\r\nWord documents saved from original MS-Word will open without problem as email attachemts, so I think its related to the way PHPWord encodes the document.",
