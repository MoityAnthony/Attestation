The colspan functionality is included in the addCell method and the rowheight functionality is in the addRow method as below:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n$table->addRow(220);\r\n$cell = $table->addCell(1250)->addText('10410043',$cell_font_style);\r\n```\r\nAfter (same output as above):\r\n```\r\n$table->addRow(220,null);\r\n$cell = $table->addCell(1250,1)->addText('10425333',$cell_font_style);\r\n```\r\nAfter (displaying new output):\r\n```\r\n$table->addRow(220,\"exact\");\r\n$cell = $table->addCell(5000,3)->addText('10425333',$cell_font_style);\r\n```",

Yet I checked the 3 files (base, cell, table) and changed my source code to generate my table as you indicated.\nIs there something I could forget?\n\nIt's the first time I use PHPWord\n\nbest regards \njc",

I haven't reviewed the code recently, so I'm a little unfamiliar but I will definitely dig it up and respond as it's been in 'production' for many months.\n\nFor reference, I encountered a need to develop PDF forms and have been spending much of my time developing scripts that work within the OpenDocument specification which I plan to contribute as they mature.\n\nAB",
