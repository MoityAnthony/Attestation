    "Description": "I find this library very useful and easy to implement. It`s working with the apache server installed on my PC and it`s working on several free hosting accounts too,  but on my paid shared hosting account I receive the following error \"Fatal error: Class 'ZipArchive' not found in [...]/PHPWord/Writer/Word2007.php on line 70\". Php version 5.22, zlib enabled. How may I install/enable zip extension on my server, without direct access to it. My system administrator told me to \"try to install the extension\" myself. Thanks",
