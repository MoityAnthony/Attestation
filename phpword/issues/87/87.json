    "Description": "So i have the following string as __input__:\r\n\r\n__'Should pay $2000.30 and give back $300.'__\r\n\r\nThe __output__ int he word doc comes out as:\r\n\r\n__'Should pay 00.30 and give back 0__ '\r\n\r\n\r\nI think, library is not able to differentiate between the variables and amounts in string. Please let me know if there is temporary fix to this issue i am working on an important project at work and this is the only thing stopping the release of project. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance :)",
