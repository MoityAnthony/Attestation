Default value is \"atLeast\", which means, that rows with lower-than-minimum heights will have minimum height regardless of specified value.\n\nYou can solve this by adding an attribute \"w:hRule\" with value \"exact\" to the \"w:tcW\" element.\n\nYou can just add:\n$objWriter->writeAttribute('w:hRule', 'exact');\nto the class PHPWord_Writer_Word2007_Base after line 401 (which should contain: \"$objWriter->writeAttribute('w:val', $height)\".\n\nThis will set fixed row heights for all rows that have height specified.",
