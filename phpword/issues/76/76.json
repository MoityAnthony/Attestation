    "Description": "If you're using PHP v5.4.27 and trying to save your word document to a specified directory, PHPWord won't save it. I had PHP v5.4.16 and I had no problem saving word files using the method below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$objWriter->save(\"FILENAME.docx\", 'path/to/save/file/');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter I upgraded the PHP version to 5.4.27 the plugin didn't save the file. There was no permission issue, no error thrown.  I had to downgrade the PHP version and it resolved the issue.",
