    "Description": "When creating a Word 2007 document with PHPWord, the files are opening in Word in \"Compatibility Mode' (displayed in the title bar of Word).  This wouldn't be a big deal, but when I add page breaks with $section->addPageBreak(), it adds a extra line at the top of the next page.  When I do a Save As in Word as a \"Word Document\" (docx), the extra line goes away.  Sure would be nice to make it a native .docx file from the start.",
