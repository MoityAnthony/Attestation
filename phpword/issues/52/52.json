If you're up for handling your file types on your own JPG,GIF and PNG, this would probably help:\n\nhttp://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imagecreatefromjpeg.php#22783\n\nIt shows how to use imagecreatefromjpeg() to fetch the image data from a URL via \"fopen()\" using a temp file until loaded into memory via the \"$imageData = LoadJPEG(\"http://www.example.com/example.jpg\");\" call.  Your next step should be \"addMemoryImage($imageData,.........\"\n\ncURL is just as capable of handling the transmission.",
